Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 

<b>Data Description<b>

In this competition we have developed algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text).

There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical for the success of your approach.

Both, training and test, data sets are provided via two different files. One (training/test_variants) provides the information about the genetic mutations, whereas the other (training/test_text) provides the clinical evidence (text) that our human experts used to classify the genetic mutations. Both are linked via the ID field.
